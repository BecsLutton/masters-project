# UU IoT PT Master's Project 2022
Repo for the various jupyter notebooks used in the project and the final datasets that were selected. 
Consolidation of jupyter notebooks not done because of library version conflicts, particularly with nupmy, tensorflow, scikit-learn and the pernutation feature importance tools.

## Note 
This repository uses git-lfs to store the large iPython notebooks. You will need to install git-lfs in order to clone the repository.
